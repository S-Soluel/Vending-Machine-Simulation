# Vending-Machine-Simulation
This java project was one of the first large projects of the semester in my introductory java course. Several files were provided to us such as the ImproperCoinsException, ImproperPurchaseException, ImproperSelectionException, and the VendingMachineInterface .java files. These provided exceptions that should be thrown in specific scenarios, and the VendingMachineInterface file gave a description of the different functions that we our fully realized vending machines should be able to perform. Additionally, the VendingMachineInterface file was implemented by the VendingMachine file as the initial outline for our virtual vending machine. After this was up and running, J-Unit testing was utilized to make sure that exceptions were being thrown for the right scenarios, and that the code was functioning as expected. 

- Description of Functions Required: VendingMachineInterface
- Main Code File: VendingMachine
- Test Files: TestingMethods, VendingMachineTester
- Exception Catching Files: ImproperCoinsException, ImproperPurchaseException, ImproperSelectionException
